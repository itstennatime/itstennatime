*Crazy how the time flies by*
*When you’re having all the best*
Scenes of your life
Colour bled from black and white
As the ticking of the clock
Changes into chime
Notice how the light goes dark
When you’re pulling at the cables
Chained to your heart
Static gives into the roar
As you realize
*You’re needed no more*

It’s hard to say our life was all a game
But maybe we get to play it all again
See yourself in control
And broadcast out the makings of your soul

Clap a little louder
Earn a better score
Everyone is saying
They want a little more
I want to hear you singing
The telephone is ringing

Crazy how the time flies by
When you’re having all the best
Scenes of your life
Colour bled from black and white
As the ticking of the clock
Changes into chime
Notice how the light goes dark
When you’re pulling at the cables
Chained to your heart
Static gives into the roar
*As You Realize*
**You’re needed no more**
***You’re needed no more***

I admit I was worried
I’d never be enough
Caught on so many hang-ups
Someone had to call my bluff
But in a stroke of luck
The perfect opportunity showed up

You got the know
I got the how
I got the name
The here and now

I fake it 
To make it
We shake up
And break it
Our one shot
The big shot
Let’s take it

Oh how hopeful I was back then
All good things come to an end
Crazy how the time flies by you
Don’t know when people leave you too
Maybe one day I’ll find something new
